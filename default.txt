## WIKI For Cms Made Simple

Welcome on your first Wiki page. From here you will be able to create et edit a lot of page

Some tips : 

*   The default language is "MarkDown". If it's the first time for you to write in "Markdown" mode, take a few moment [to read this](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
*   If you can't see the button Edition, it's maybe because you are not logged or maybe the page is protected. See the admin panel to learn more.
*   Like most of wiki, you don't have to create a page before linking it. Every links pointing to a [no-existing page will be coloured in RED](aNewPage). On the other side, a link pointing on an another wiki page will be [coloured in BLUE](home)
*   HTML tags like `<b>bold</b>` or `<a href='#'>links</a>` could be processed by the motor "MarkDown" in a normal case but for security reasons it's disabled in the module WIKI by default.
*   Smarty tags and CmsMadeSimple tags like `{"hello"|capitalize}` or `{News}` are not processed by the motor "MarkDown" unless the administrator setted it in the admin panel of the module. The tag root_url is the only Smarty tag to be processed : {root_url}

In fact, the "MarkDown" language is a **editorial language** and not a **programmatic language** (like Smarty is)
 
And finally, here some advice by "Duky", the loyal Duck.
